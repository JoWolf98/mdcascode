# Microsoft Defende for Cloud as Code
The purpose of this project is to provide tools to enable automatic deployment of Microsoft defender for cloud through Github Actions 
The project has several folders for each of the different Microsoft Defender for cloud  components that can be configured (Onboard, Plans, Multicloud Onboarding AWS & GCP, Workbooks, Workflow Automation) plus folders for script helpers and Github Action YAML pipelines. In this README we explain some of the basics for each of them but we encourage you to visit each of the folders for more details on how to use the tools.
